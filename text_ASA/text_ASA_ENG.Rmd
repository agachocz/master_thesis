# Introduction {.unnumbered}

The word "democracy" is frequently used in politic declarations, shouted out on demonstrations, spoken in media as well as in privat conversations. Commonly, the subject goes beyond what is considered as "democracy" in political sciences, i.e. *"Democracy means only that the people have the opportunity of accepting or refusing the men who are to rule them"* [@Schumpeter]. A discrepancy between a formal definition and its common understanding shouldn't be surprising, however I would argue it's a serious issue in this context. The Earth won't stop orbiting the Sun, even if all human populace belive otherwise, but the shape of democratic systems actually depends on how their citizens conceptualise democracy. And their concepts may not be "correct", and may not be universal.

The problem can be especially pressing in international comparative reaserches. If we measure the state of democracy or social attitude toward it, based on one arbitrary concept of democracy, we may miss the real reasons behind people's choices. This paper is intended to explore Europeans' belives on the essentials of democracy, based on data gathered by World Values Survey. It will reveal the social concepts of democracy, measure their popularity, and check their comparability across the Europe.

This paper is organised as follows. The first chapter summarise the most common ways of defining and measuring democracy, based on theoretical concepts as well as on social surveys. The second one presents the factor analysis model, which will be used in empirical research, and the issue of measurement invariance, which is a condition of a proper multi-group factor analysis. The following chapters describe the empirical research and some conclusions drawn from it.

# The quantitative measures of democracy


## Why do we need to measure democracy?

The need of a quantitative measure of the state of democracy came into existance in the second half of 20th century in the USA. It was belived, that democratic countries are less likely to engage in wars, especially against other democracies. For people responsible for US' intarnational policies, leveling up democracy in the key regions seemed necessery to establish a world peace [@Doorenspleet]. Some kind of index was needed to compare countries' states of democracy, and judging how far they are from an ideal democracy, or whether democratisation efforts actually worked out.

Beside that, expressing democracy with a number opens wide possibilities to use statistical model in research of democracy, both as an exo- and endogenous variable. It allowed to examine couses, effects, and properties of democracy in more reliable, methodologically correct and reproducible way. Partly in account to that, the straight-forward connection between a state of democracy and peace has been undermined by scholars [@Doorenspleet]. Still, democracy continues to be a subject of intense researches, which suffer from several difficulties. 

First of all, international studies need to deal with problematic cultural and linguistic differences, that make objectivity challenging and generalisations risky. The second problem is the definition itself, as it is chosen arbitrarily, and not always clearly stated. Finally, reaserches show that the concept of democracy is highly susceptible to emotions [@JaskoKoss]. People are used to thinking of democracy not as one of possible forms of political system, but rather as its ideal state. That's why so many countries with democracy in their name are commonly considered authoritarian. It leads to cramming into concept of democracy all the ideas, that one perceives as good for the commonwealth, whether they are a part of political system or not. 

Based on minimalistic definition, democracy in its core is a mechanism of forcing policies without using violence. The will of majority needs to be accepted, not because majority is necessarily right, but because those opposing it have always major power against them - despite that nowadays power is more connected to technical advancement than the number [@Przeworski]. As Przeworski further notices, durability and quality of democracy depends on several factors, both political and economic. When people act for or against democracy, they may do so because they're convinced they can gain from it - not bacause they believe in specific formal system. That's why it's worth to try to define democracy based on people's expectations, not on the mechanism of changing the rulers.


## Indices of democracy

The majority of democracy indices is based on expert's assessments. Countries are granted points for meeting specified standards. This means, that each case is compared to a concept of ideal democracy, chosen by experts. There exists some indices based on minimalistic concept with binary scale (is democratic or not), however they are mostly used to analyse the duration of democratic regimes [@Coppedge], as they put democracies at very different states to the same box.

One of the most popular indices is is annually computed by an american organisation Freedom House [@Doorenspleet]. Freedom House Index (FH) uses a 7-grade scale to rate the state of political and civil rights (the lower the better). Despite it wasn't even designed as a measure of democracy, it is widely used as such [@Coppedge], because it reflects the prevailing concept of liberal democracy.

However useful, democracy indices faced a lot of criticism. It was argued, that they rely too much on the formal procedures and the state of law, and not how it is actually implemented; and that too loose criteria allow experts to project they opinion of country's democracy on the score [@Coppedge]. Especially FH Index met with an accusation of conservative and pro-market bias, which led to underrating leftist or muslim governments [@Doorenspleet].


## Social concept of democracy

On the other side, we can study democracy as it is viewed by citizens themselves. It is not an alternative way to the same goal (as it won't provide a one-size-fits-all definition, that would allow world-wide comparations), but rather an attempt to examine a concept of democracy shared by people, who have established or are supporting it.

It was showed by @Campbell, that at the base of common support for democracy lies the process of modernisation, which touched all aspects of human life and made changes "everyone's interest". As the main reasons for this support he lists: a)$~$involvement in social organisations, which *"provides an antidote to apathy and alienation and projects a climate of trust onto the polity"*, b)$~$economic factors - prosperity boosts support, which dissolve in harder times, c)$~$behavioral factors, which cause that people in general support a winning, most popular option.

The survey conducted by @JaskoKoss showed also, that democracy is identified with some set of moral and civil values (the standard of freedom), or with *"providing safty and well-being for all, and solving problems of the poor"*^[Translated by author.] (the standard of welfere). 

Support for democracy is not sourced mainly from its political properties, but partly because people are used to it, and partly because of the civil and economic safety they expect it can provide.

# Multi-group factor analysis


## A factor analysis model

Social scientists frequently deal with non-measurable phenomenon. Their existence can be suspected by observing the way they impact the others, measurable properties. The same applies to a social concept of democracy, which may not be directly defined or even concious, but it reveal itself in people's choices and opinions. The method of statistical modeling in such cases was first proposed by Spearman [@Everitt], and it will be briefly summarised in this chapter.

The general factor analysis model can be described by the set of equations (\ref{eq:latent-model}). Factors (or latent constructs) $\lambda$ impact measurable variables (indicators) $X$ with factor loadings $\alpha$.


\begin{align} 
\label{eq:latent-model}
\begin{split}
x_1 &= \alpha_{01} + \alpha_{11} \lambda_1 + ... + \alpha_{k1} \lambda_k + \epsilon_1\\
& \vdotswithin{=} \\
x_p &= \alpha_{0p} + \alpha_{1p} \lambda_1 + ... + \alpha_{kp} \lambda_k + \epsilon_p\\
\end{split}
\end{align}

Each element $x$ and $\epsilon$ is an n-element vector. We assume, that indicators are conditionally independent. It means, that the relation between any two $x$ comes solely from the fact, that they are impacted by one or more shared latent factors. This can be described by the equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:shared-var}
\sigma_{ij} = \sum_{r=1}^k \alpha_{ir} \alpha_{jr} \text{, gdzie } i \neq j
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_ij$ is an element of the cross-covariance matrix of $X$. If we denote as $\psi_i$ a variance of error ($\epsilon$) of i-th variable, a variance of each $x$ can be described as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:spec-var}
\sigma_{ii} = \sum_{j=1}^k \alpha_{ij}^2 + \psi_i
\end{equation}

where the first segment denote volatility shared by $x_i$ with other variables through common latent factors, and the second segment is its specific variance. Because all latent variables are unknown, estimation is based on cross-covariance matrix. The key is to find such values of parameters, that would match with variances and covariances. Incorrectly specified model may not be identified, or may have wrong properties, e.g. negative estimated variances. 

Model is identified, if there can be found only one set of parameters' values. If this condition is not met, the parameters can't be interpreted [@ESSEduNet]. The problem is, a model with latent factors can never be strictly identified.

A cross-covariance matrix with elements described previously in equations (\ref{eq:shared-var}) and (\ref{eq:spec-var}), can be expressed in matrix format:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-matrix}
\Sigma = A A' + \Psi
\end{equation}

where $A$ is a $k$x$n$ matrix of latent factors, and $\Psi$ is a diagonal matrix of specific variances. It can be noted, that for orthogonal $n$x$n$ matrix $T$ (i.e. such that multiplied by its transposition gives an identity matrix):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:scaling}
A T (A T)' + \Psi = A T T' A' + \Psi = A A' + \Psi = \Sigma
\end{equation}

This means, that the factor loadings can't be identified, and matrix $A$ can be identified only up to multiplying by any othogonal matrix [@Shapiro]. Thus, factor loadings cannot be directly interpreted, like parameters in regression model. Moreover, they can be freely scaled to set the variance of latent factor on a desired level, typically 1.

Accounting to that, a factor analysis model is said to be identified when all possible sets of parameters come from scaling a matrix of loadings. Only if after choosing a scale model isn't fully identified, it needs to be modified [@ESSEduNet].


## Estimation of a factor analysis model

Having measures $X$ we can compute the cross-covariance matrix $S$,  and mimalise difference between $S$ and $\Sigma$ to find the values of parameters. Commonly used Maximum Likelihood method assumes multivariete normal distribution of observations, although the problems arising from breaking this condition can be overcome by using robust standard errors and scaling test statistics [@Rosseel, @SatorraBentler]. ML method minimalises the function opposite to log-likelihood, given by the equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:loglikelihood}
l(S, \Sigma) = ln|\Sigma| - ln|S| + trace(S \Sigma^{-1}) - p
\end{equation}

We can then compute the Goodness of Fit Index (GFI):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gfi}
GFI = \frac{l(S, \Sigma)}{n-1} \text{   } \sim \chi^2 (\frac{(p-k)^2 - (p+k)}{2})
\end{equation}

GFI allows to test the null hypothesis, that a cross-covariance matrix assumed by model is identical with the observed one. However, this statistic is dependent on $n$, and for big samples it may be too sensitive for small inaccuracies, to be used in real-life cases [@CheungRens]. There are many others indicators of goodnes of fit. It is verified that the CFI (Comparative Fit Index) and the TLI (Tucker-Lewis Index) should be equal or bigger than 0.95, whereas the RMSEA (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation) shouldn't exceed 0.06 [@HuBentler]. 


## Measurement invariance 

Comparative researches are one of the main advantages of factor analysis. As it was explained before, factor loadings don't have an interpretation, however they become meaningful in comparison between groups, e.g. of different age, gender, culture, or in other time points [@Pokropek]. The biggest difficulty is that researcher needs to make sure - especially when dealing with highly diverse groups - that the relationship between latent and measurable variables is identical across all groups. That property is called a measurement invariance [@ChenEtAl].

In a factor analysis model, the latent factor is estimated based on relationship between measurable variables. Lack of measurment invariance means, that in some groups exist other, unnoticed relationship, and its impact will be interpreted as an impact of other latent factor [@HirBra]. To describe this situation, let's assume that the real notion of phenomenon in the group **A** is a set of equations (\ref{eq:delta-model}), and in group **B** - a set of equations (\ref{eq:latent-model}). If the researcher overlook the problem, and estimate the model (\ref{eq:latent-model}) in all cases, the impact of latent factor $\delta$ in the group **A** will be assigned to $\lambda$, which can be of entirely different nature.


\begin{align}
\label{eq:delta-model}
\begin{split}
x_1 &= \alpha_{01} + \alpha_{11} \lambda_1 + ... + \alpha_{k1} \lambda_k + \beta_1 \delta + \epsilon_1 \\
& \vdotswithin{=} \\
x_p &= \alpha_{0p} + \alpha_{1p} \lambda_1 + ... + \alpha_{kp} \lambda_k + \beta_p \delta + \epsilon_p \\
\end{split}
\end{align}

Incompatible relationships between measurable variables may have variety of causes. In the international studies it can be lack of direct translation, cultural differences, historical context, etc. For egzample, the english word "neighborhood" means the closest space, whereas in german it is relater to social closeness - which caused some problems in translating the Bogardus social distance scale [@Pokropek]. @ArDav found the problem with measurment invariance in the study of attidute toward democracy.

On the other hand, the groups' differences, discoverd through test of measurement invariance, shouldn't be treated merely as a caveat (unless they don't result from researcher's mistake, e.g. a bad translation). They can give a great insight into how different groups view and conceptualise reality [@CheungRens].

Measurement invariance is usually tested on three levels: configural, metric and scalar [@ArDav]. The first one is fulfilled, if the same model is identified and fits the data in all groups.  If the concept is well-known and there are no deep differences, configural invariancs shouldn't be challenging [@LubGlog]. In international studies it can be broken due to translation errors, or when concepts are based on specific cultural context and have different meaning in different groups [@CheungRens]. Problems with the first level of invariance don't allow to apply the model to multi-group comparison.

Metric invariance means, that the factor loadings in each groups have the same levels. In other words, the impact's size of latent factor on measurable variables is identical. Otherwise, we couldn't say whether observed differences in indicators' levels in groups are caused by actual differences in factors' levels, or by differences in the way factors affect the observations. To test the measurement invariance, we need to perform two models in each group: one with freely estimated factor loadings, and the second one with restriction, that respective loadings have to be the same in every group. If unrestricted model comes out significantly better (tested with Likelihood Ratio Test), the condition of metric invariance is broken.

Metric invariance allows a multi-group comparison, where latent factors are used as exogenous variables. Since the relationships between latent and measurable variables are statistically equal across groups, the change of latent variable would cause the same change of measurable variables in every group. It doesn't allow, however, to use the factor as an endogenous variable, as different groups can have different constants (parameter $\alpha_{01}$ in equation \ref{eq:latent-model}).

It leads as to scalar invariance, where model's structure and all parameters are equal across groups. The process of testing is the same as for metric invariance, with restrinctions imposed on both factor loadings and constants. There are possible other types of invariance (e.g. of errors of approximation), although they don't present any additional advantages to comparative researches.

# A factor analysis of concepts of democracy 


## Data


World Values Survey is an international organisation, focused on political, social, economic, religious and cultural values around the world [@WVSData]. Their survey, conducted once in every few years in almost 100 countries, covers the topic of democracy as well.

The respondents were asked 10 questions, each ranged on 10-point scale. In the first 9 questions respondents were asked to asses, to what extent a given property of the state is an essential characteristic of democracy (1 - not essential, 10 - definitely essential):

1. Governments tax the rich and subsidize the poor;
2. Religious authorities ultimately interpret the laws;
3. People choose their leaders in free elections;
4. People receive state aid for unemployment;
5. The army takes over when government is incompetent;
6. Civil rights protect people from state oppression;
7. The state makes people’s incomes equal;
8. People obey their rulers;
9. Women have the same rights as men.

In the last questions a responded needed to determine, how important it is to live in democratic country (1 - not at all important, 10 - absolutly important). 

Variables containing answers for all above questions will be noted as X1 - X10. I used data from 6th Wave (2010-2014) from all geographicly european countries covered in survey. There are: **Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Germany, Kazakhstan, Netherland, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, and Ukraine**

```{r load-data}
dem_data <- read.table("dem_data_even.csv")
questions <- c("Taxes for rich, aid for poor",
               "Influence of religious authorities",
               "Free elections",
               "Help for unemployed",
               "Army can take over",
               "Civil rights",
               "Income equality",
               "Obeying rulers",
               "Gender equality",
               "Importance of democracy")
names(questions) <- c("taxRich", "religiousLaw", "freeElection", "helpUnemp", 
                      "armyTakesOver", "civilRights", "equalIncome", "obeyRulers",
                      "genderEquality", "importance")
```

```{r descr-plot, fig.align = 'left', fig.width = 7, fig.height = 8, fig.cap = "Distribution of answers on questions about the essence of democracy. Source of data: WVS Wave 6."}

dem_data %>% 
  gather(key = "variable", value = "answer", -country, factor_key = T) %>%
  ggplot(aes(answer)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10, col = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~variable, nrow = 5, scales = "free", 
    labeller = labeller(variable = questions)) + theme_light() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "serif")) +
  scale_x_continuous("Answer", breaks = 1:10) +
  scale_y_continuous("Number of answers")
```

`r fig_nums(name = "descr-plot", display = "cite")` presents the histograms of answers in the whole sample. This basic plot already suggest, that minimalistic Schumpeter's concept of democracy is not enough for european society. Citizens commonly believe, that democracy means not only "free elections", but also civil rights, gender equality, and - what is probably more surprising - help for unemployed. In voters opinion, a possibility to choose the rulers is not enough to have a democratic country. These rulers need to satisfy the basic needs of freedom, equality, and economic safty of the ruled. 

One can also notice a common believe, that a democratic system doesn't need an intervention form army or religious leaders. Respondents were less unanimous in the question of redistribution or income inequality. Majority consider it as essential for democracy, although the dominance of the highest answer is not that striking.


## Analysis of correlation

When a respondent answer the question "how essential [something] is as a characteristic of democracy?", they need to invoke some concept of democracy and check, if the property lies withing it. If there exist widely acknowledged concept of democracy, covering part of the questions, we can expect answers to these questions to be highly correlated. Respondents will answer in the similar way, because they share the same concept of democracy. Consequently, if there is no common social concept (i.e. how people understand democracy is highly individual), we can expect no significant relationship between answers. I will measure the relationship as Spearman's correlation coefficient, as the scale is long enaugh to be treated as numeric variable [@Revelle].

A concept of democracy can be expressed as a latent factor, which impacts answers (measurable variables). There can exist several concept, but not more than questions. The answer for a given question can be affected by more than one concept. It's worth mentioning, that the concepts can be specified only up to the topics covered by questions. It's impossible to say, whether a concept include some other opinions, e.g. on bioethics. Theoretically, there can exist as well some other concepts, based on ideas not coverd in questionare, therefore they can't be revealed in this research.


`r fig_nums(name = "cor-matrix", display = "cite")` presents a correlation matric of answers. It was tested with Bartlett's test of sphericity, which confirmed the significance of relationships between variables ($\chi^2$ = 26276.56; $df$ = 45; $p$ < 0,001).


```{r cor-matrix, fig.align = 'left', fig.cap = "Correlation matrix of answers. Source of data: WVS Wave 6."}

cor.matrix <- cor(dem_data[,2:11], method="spearman")

quest.short <- c("X1: Taxing the rich",
                  "X2: Religious authorities",
                  "X3: Free elections",
                  "X4: Help for unemployed",
                  "X5: Army takes over",
                  "X6: Civil rights",
                  "X7: Income equality",
                  "X8: Obeying rulers",
                  "X9: Gender equality",
                  "X10: Importance of democracy")

colnames(cor.matrix) <- c("X1", "X2", "X3", "X4", "X5", "X6", "X7", "X8", "X9", "X10")
rownames(cor.matrix) <- quest.short

par(family = 'serif')
corrplot(cor.matrix, method="circle", order='hclust', tl.col = "black", tl.cex = 0.7)
```


On `r fig_nums("cor-matrix", display = "cite")` we can clearly see three clusters, which suggest the existence of three separate concepts of democracy:
 
- Concept I: variables denoting the obedience to rulers, an influence of religious authorities, a possibility of rules of army, and (to some extent) income equality;
- Concept II: income equality, higher taxes for rich, help for unemployed;
- Concept III: help for unemployed, gender equality, free elections and civil rights;

The first conception is characterised mostly by a belief, that a democracy in its core needs an ingerention of aome kind of third party: army and religious authhorities. It values obedience of citizens. It seems that this conception is built around the need of order and creal relations of power, although it also contains opinion about income inequality. This conception is negatively correlated with the third one, and more importantly - with the importance of living in democratic country at the beggining. Moreover, it doesn't seem to correspond with any theoretical knowledge. Supposedly, people with this conception in minds actually don't value democracy, but having beed asked for its essential, project the properties of their ideal (not democratic) system on it, anyway.

The second concept view democracy as a warranter of economic benefits and safty. Its supporters expect from their government to fight income inequality, tax rich, help poor and unemployed. It shows simmilarities to the concept of welfare-state.

In the last conception, democracy is a system characterised by free election, social freedom and equality, but also supporting unemployed. Despite it goes well beyond definition proposed by Schumpeter (where free election would suffice), from these three it is the closest to definitions known in political sciences. Supporters of this conception view democracy as a warranter of social and political rights, and they show a strong need to live in democratic state.

Interestingly, that variables describing opinions on income inequality and higher taxes for rich, are positively correlated with almost any other variable.

It's good to compare `r fig_nums("cor-matrix", display = "cite")` with information drawn from `r fig_nums("descr-plot", display = "cite")`. An analysis of correlation allows merely to reason about the shape and cohesion of conceptions, and not about their popularity (how many people actually support them) and their place on the scale of answers. `r fig_nums("descr-plot", display = "cite")` suggest, that Concept III is the most popular, and its supporters were chosing the highest scores for opinions connected to it. On the other hand, supporters of Concept I were probably choosing rather low scores for questions about army or religious authorities - although relatively high, compared to rest of the population. It is also possible, that the relationships forming this conception, function more like an "anti-conception", i.e. a common notion, how democracy *shouldn't* look like.

Conceptions II and III seem to confirm the studies of @JaskoKoss, refered in Chapter 1. They represent, respectively, the "standard of welfare" and the "standard of freedom". It's also compatible with the analysis of the support for democracy, performed by @Campbell. Support for democracy based on a favorable economic situation, clearly shows, that citizens expect from a democratic system to ensure the common welfare (Concept II). Next, if the people trust democratic institutions because of the possibility to engage in social and political activities, we can expect they treat this civil freedom as the essential part of democracy. It is closely conncected with the postulates of civil rights, free elections, and gender equality (as women's emancipation allowed them to take full and active part in social and political life), which are crucial to the Concept III. The behavioral part of support for democracy, mentioned by Campbell, cannot be confirmed here, as it is not related to one's concept of democracy.

We can also consider the social concepts of democracy from quite a different angle, if we think of what makes them persist. In turbulent times researchers tend to believe, that the world turns its back toward democracy, although for now data seem to deny it [@Doorenspleet]. We can ask, what can make a country overthrow the form of government, commonly though to be the best possible option. It turns out, even if citizens are not content with their rulers, they are not willing to give up a democratic system, as long as it provides basic rights, and satisfies basic needs. However, an unstable economic situation can be a serious challenge for young democracies, as it was in the case of East European Countries at the end of 20th century [@Klingemann].

The fact, that citizens are able to reject the system, that won't meet their expectations, may seem to be a truism. But it reveal a big caveat in elitist definition of democracy: people don't consider democracy as a system, that allows them to choose the rulers as they please - but as a system, that gives the greatest opportunities to realise their needs, both social and economic. The mechanism of choosing rulers is just a mean to reach a goal, not a goal itself.


## A structural model


```{r model-all}
model <- '
fundamentalistic =~ obeyRulers + religiousLaw + armyTakesOver + equalIncome;
economic =~ taxRich + equalIncome + helpUnemp;
liberal =~ freeElection + genderEquality + civilRights + importance + helpUnemp'


fit <- cfa(model, data = dem_data, estimator = "MLR")
```

Model's structure is shown on `r fig_nums(name = "diagram-all", display = "cite")` in a standard graphic representation of structural equations [@Everitt]. Latent factors are represented by circles, measurable variables by squares, and estimated values of factor loadings are written on straight lines. The curved lines represent variances or covariances. The model was estimated using Robust Maximum Likelihood Method, with the variance of latent factors set as 1.


```{r diagram-all, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Factor analysis model for the whole sample. Source of data: WVS Wave 6."}
par(family = 'serif')

quest.min <- c(obeyRulers = "X8", religiousLaw = "X2", armyTakesOver = "X5", 
               equalIncome = "X7", taxRich = "X1", helpUnemp = "X4", freeElection = "X3", 
               genderEquality = "X9", civilRights = "X6", importance = "X10", "I", "II", "III")

par(family = 'serif')
semPaths(object = fit,
         whatLabels = "std",           
         edge.label.cex = 1, nCharNodes = 0,         
         layout = "circle2",  sizeMan = 7, sizeMan2 = 7, shapeMan = "square",
         sizeLat = 7, sizeLat2 = 7, shapeLat = "circle",
         sizeInt = 5, sizeInt2 = 5,    
         what = "std", edge.color = "black",
         nodeLabels = quest.min, optimizeLatRes = T)
```


Concept I has the strongest impact on the opinion on the role of religious authorities, and posiiobilty of army's takeover. Concept II affects mainly the view on taxation and support for the poor, whereas Concept III - free election, with gender equality and civil rights in second place. Concepts II and III are positively correlated on a medium level (0.5). Concept I is faintly, positively correlated with Concept II, but negatively with Concept III.

Model has quite good, but not great properties, with CFI = 0.947, TLI = 0.921, and RMSEA = 0.06 (0.057; 0.064). The Composite Reliability equals 0.74, which means that questions make good representation of considered conceptions.

For each observation in the sample, we can now compute the numeric value of each conception, taken as weighted average, where factor loadings are weights. It can be interpreted as the measure of how strongly a respondent agree with a given concept. `r fig_nums(name = "stats-all", display = "cite")` presents the distributions of democracy concepts in the whole sample.

It's clear that people are the least likely to agree with Concept I (average 4.26), next with Concept (average 6.75) and the most with Concept III (8.3). For each conception I also counted respondents, for whom it was the most important one (the chart on the bottom). The group of people with dominant Concept III is obviously the most numerous.

The question is, if the model is measurement invariant, i.e. if we can use the computed indices to measure the differences in support for conceptions between countries. To test the first level of measurement invariance - the configural invariance - I attempted to estimate this model for each country separately. It turned out, for some groups (namely for Georgia and Slovenia), model couldn't be correctly estimated, which means, that it doesn't fit the data. Configural invariance isn't met.

In order to achive a common, international set of conception one could exclude these countries and try to repeat the procedure. But that would only ommit the problem, as rejecting part of the group stray as further from forming any knowledge on the whole. However, one could expect, that there exist in Europe some subgroups of countries with opinions on democracy similar enough, to form the common concepts. The next chapter will describe an attempt to find these groups, model their concepts, and show differences.

# Clustering countries by similarity of their opinions on democracy


## Method


As the concepts shows through relationships between answers, we should look for the groups of countries with the most similar relationships structure, i.e. the correlation matrix. I have computed a correlation matrix for each country and grouped them with hierarhic, aglomerative method AGNES. The result is presented on `r fig_nums(name = "dendrogram", display = "cite")`. At the beggining each country is treated like a separate cluster (bottom part of the diagram). In each oncoming steps, an euclidean distance between means of every pair of clusters is computed, and then the closest two clusters are being combined into one. Algorythm ends, when all countries are jointed in one cluster (the pick of dendrogram) [@Struyf]. The high is mearured as the distance between two clusters, that are being merged in a given step [@MaechRouss]. Clusters, that are merged in the lowest high, have the most similar patterns of answers - so we can guess these answers are affected by the same conceptions of democracy.



```{r dendrogram, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Grupowanie państw według podobieństwa macierzy korelacji metodą aglomeracyjną. Źródło: opracowanie własne."}
dg <- as.dendrogram(clustering)

ggdendrogram(dg) + labs(y = "Wysokość") + 
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(size = 0.5, color = "lightgrey"),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_line(size = 0.5, color = "lightgrey"),
        text = element_text(family = "serif"))
```

`r fig_nums(name = "dendrogram", display = "cite")` shows three distinct groups, which was mapped geographically on the `r fig_nums(name = "map2", display = "cite")`. The first one (marked green on the map) is made by Middle-East European countries and Georgia. The second one (marked red) contains mostly by countries lying by the Black Sea, but also Slovenia and Spain. The third group (marked blue) contains North-West Europe countries. A geographical patterns is discernible, though not definitive. The big issue is a limited range of the survey. There are no data from most of the Western and Southern Europe, and it's hard to speculate, how their citizens would tend to answer.


```{r map2, fig.cap = "Mapa podziału na grupy według podobieństwa macierzy korelacji. Źródło: opracowanie własne.", out.width="450px"}
include_graphics("map2.png")
```

The quality of clustering was verified with a silhouette index (`r fig_nums(name = "silhouette", display = "cite")`). The index takes values from -1 to 1, where negative values signify observation placed in the wrong group, positive ones - in the proper group, and values close to zero - the observations that doesn't seem to match any of the groups [@Rousseeuw]. As we can see from the plot, there is no justification for moving and country to a different group. On the other hand, all values are rather low, which indicates that clustering is not very distinctive. The closest to zero values were obtained for Turkey (0.017), Slovenia (0.039) and Spain (0.102) in the red group. As the clusters are only a hint for where to look for common concepts of democracy, I decided to preserve the groups in their original shape, as long as it will not cause problems with estimation. In the oncoming sections I will perform a factor analysis for each grop separately and check for measurement invariance within them.


```{r silhouette, fig.align = 'center', fig_width = 7, fig_height = 7, fig.cap = "Test sylwetkowy grupowania, Źródło: opracowanie własne."}
tree <- cutree(clustering, 3) #dendrogram
sil <- silhouette(tree, clustering$diss)

sil_data <- data.frame(countr.pl, cluster = sil[,1], width = sil[,3])
sil_data$countr.pl <- reorder(sil_data$countr.pl, sil_data$cluster)
sil_data$cluster <- as.factor(sil_data$cluster)

ggplot(sil_data) + 
  geom_col(aes(x = countr.pl, y = width, fill = cluster)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkgreen", "blue", "red")) +
  coord_flip() + labs(x = "Państwo", y = "Wskaźnik sylwetkowy", fill = "Grupa") +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "serif"))
```


## Group marked in green

The first group contain five countries: Poland, Belarus, Estonia, Romania, and Georgia. These countries have many similarities, mainly communist governments influenced by USSR after the II World War, and revolutionary changes in 80s and 90s. The correlation matrix is showed on `r fig_nums(name = "cor-matrix-1", display = "cite")`. It is confirmed to be significant by a Bartlett's test of sphericity ($\chi^2$ = 12861,33; $df$ = 45; $p$ < 0,001). Relationships between answers seem to be similar to those in the full sample. We can still distinguish three conception, though they seem more blurry.


```{r cor-matrix-1, fig.align = 'left', fig.cap = "Correlation matrix of answers in the group marked with green. Source of data: WVS Wave 6."}

group1_countries <- countries[tree == 1]
group1_data <- dem_data %>% filter(country %in% group1_countries)

group1_cor <- cor(group1_data[,2:11], method="spearman")

colnames(group1_cor) <- c("X1", "X2", "X3", "X4", "X5", "X6", "X7", "X8", "X9", "X10")
rownames(group1_cor) <- quest.short

par(family = 'serif')
corrplot(group1_cor, method="circle", order='hclust', tl.col = "black", tl.cex = 0.7)
```

The structre of the model and result of estimation is presented on the diagram on `r fig_nums(name = "diagram-1", display = "cite")`. CFI = 0,969, TLI = 0,953 and RMSEA equals 0,045, with CI90% (0,040; 0,050), so the model is definietly well fitted. Composite Reliability equals 0.75.

[nazwy koncepcji???]


W tej grupie występuje koncepcja IIlud ze zmienną posłuszeństwo rządzącym, ale wyraźnie większe znaczenie ma w niej wyrównywanie przez państwo dochodów. Można interpretować to jako wizję paternalistycznego państwa, które wymaga posłuszeństwa, ale zaspokaja podstawowe potrzeby bytowe i chroni najsłabszych przed wyzyskiem. Warto też zwrócić uwagę na układ korelacji między zmiennymi latentnymi: w grupie ogólnej i grupie demokracji liberalnych koncepcje opiekuńczego państwa były silniej związane z koncepcją III - tutaj z koncepcją I.

The results of testing measeurement invariance are presented in `r table_nums(name = "tab-gr-1", display = "cite")`. Model from `r fig_nums(name = "diagram-1", display = "cite")` is identified in all countries in the group, which mean it fulfill the condition of configural invariance. But models with restrictions on, respectively, factor loadings and constants, turned out to be significantly worse ($p$ < 0,001 in both cases). Metric and scalar invariance are not met. In other words, countries from the green group have the same common concepts of democracy, but they vary in the intensity of impact, and don't allow numeric comparison.

## Group marked in blue

This group contains only three countries: Germany, Netherland, and Sweden. It is also the most concise geographicaly. Correlation matrix is presented on `r fig_nums(name = "cor-matrix-2", display = "cite")`, and was proved to be significant ($\chi^2$ = 22256,39; $df$ = 45; $p$ < 0,001). It reveals similar concept as those in the whole sample, presented on the diagram on `r fig_nums(name="diagram-west", display = "cite")`.

Concepts II and III has already been described. There is one new concept - denoted here as IBlue - similar to Concept I from `r fig_nums(name="diagram-all", display = "cite")`, but with no connection to income equality. CFI = 0.965; TLI =  0.950. RMSEA = 0.043, with CI90% (0.038; 0.049). Composite Reliability equals 0.62, so is quite low, despite good properties of the model. The group is characterised by strong negative correlation between concepts III and IBlue, and rather weak relationships of Conctep II with any other.

Distributions of concepts' impact indices are shown on `r fig_nums(name = "stats-west", display = "cite")`. Concept IBlue has average of 2.56, with values over 7 being outliers. Concept II has average of 6.11, and III - 8.7, with only outliers below 6.

## Group marked in red

The second group contains Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Spain, and Slovenia. Correlation matrix is presented on `r fig_nums(name = "cor-matrix-3", display = "cite")`, and was proved to be significant ($\chi^2$ = 22256,39; $df$ = 45; $p$ < 0,001).

This tam an analysis found only two factors: Concept I and a new Concept IV, with structure presented on the diagram on `r fig_nums(name = "diagram-3", display = "cite")`. Interesting characteristic of this group is a positive correlation of obediance to rulers with every other variable - the opposite to what was found in group marked in blue.


```{r cor-matrix-3, fig.align = 'left', fig.cap = "Correlation matrix of answers in the group marked with red. Source of data: WVS Wave 6."}

group3_countries <- countries[tree == 3]
group3_data <- dem_data %>% filter(country %in% group1_countries)

group3_cor <- cor(group1_data[,2:11], method="spearman")

colnames(group3_cor) <- c("X1", "X2", "X3", "X4", "X5", "X6", "X7", "X8", "X9", "X10")
rownames(group3_cor) <- quest.short

par(family = 'serif')
corrplot(group3_cor, method="circle", order='hclust', tl.col = "black", tl.cex = 0.7)
```


With CFI = 0.876, TLI =  0.831, RMSEA = 0.091 with CI90% (0.087; 0.099), and Composite Reliability = 0.74, this model is not ideal. As far as the Concept I is well constructed (Composite Reliability equals 0.78), it seems to lack questions to truly reveal Concept I (CR = 0.56). We can notice, that the socio-political part is stronger than the economic one in Concept IV, and opinion on obeing rulers was similar in both concepts.

```

Distributions of concepts' impact indices, presented on `r fig_nums(name = "stats-gr-3", display = "cite")`, show Concept IV to be more popular. The avarage for it is 7.77, whereas for Concept I it's 4.56.

# Conclusions

Performed analysis bears plenty of conclusions about social concepts of democracy in European Countries. First of all, it proves that common belives on the essence of democracy go way beyond a minimalistic definition. The set of concepts isn't common for the whole continent, but I found three groups, within which the common concepts can be found. Still, it doesn't allow meaningful numeric comparison, as the higher levels of measurement invariance were not met in any of the groups. 

The first group containes Poland, Estonia, Romania, Belarus, and Georgia. It has three conception of democracy. 

Druga grupa składa się z Polski, Estonii, Rumunii, Białorusi i Gruzji. Wyróżniono w niej również trzy koncepcje, I i III wymienione wyżej, oraz koncepcję IIlud, podobną do II. W koncepcji IIlud na pierwsze miejsce wybija się tu walka z nierównościami dochodowymi. W niedużym, ale istotnym stopniu, jest w niej też zawarte przekonanie o konieczności posłuszeństwa wobec rządzących. Koncepcja IIlud jest silnie pozytywnie skorelowana z I, nie ma z kolei związków tych dwóch koncepcji z III. Można przypuszczać, że na kształt tych koncepcji miała wpływ komunistyczna przeszłość państw tej grupy, sprawiając, że postulaty socjalne są związane z posłuszeństwem wobec władzy i możliwością przejęcia władzy przez armię. Zdecydowanie więcej jest jednak zwolenników koncepcji III.

W grupie państw, w których po II Wojnie Światowej rozwijała się idea demokracji liberalnej (Niemcy, Holandia, Szwecja) można wyróżnić trzy koncepcje demokracji. Według koncepcji I istotna dla demokracji jest możliwość przejęcia władzy przez wojsko, interpretacja prawa przez autorytety religijne oraz posłuszeństwo rządzącym. Według II najistotniejsze jest, aby państwo wyżej opodatkowało bogatych i pomagało ubogim, a także wspierało bezrobotnych i walczyło z rozwarstwieniem dochodowym. W koncepcji III istotę demokracji stanowią wolne wybory, równość płci, prawa obywatelskie oraz (w mniejszym stopniu) również wsparcie państwa dla bezrobotnych. Ta trzecia koncepcja jest zdecydowanie najbardziej powszechna i silnie ujemnie skorelowana z pierwszą. 





Trzecia grupa jest najbardziej zróżnicowana pod względem geograficznym, politycznym i historycznym. Znajdują się w niej państwa: Hiszpania, Słowenia, Ukraina, Turcja, Kazachstan i Rosja. W tej grupie znaleziono tylko dwie koncepcje demokracji: jedna łączy oczekiwania wolności, równości i praw obywatelskich z postulatami socjalnymi (koncepcja IV); druga uznaje za istotne przede wszystkim  wpływ autorytetów religijnych na prawo, możliwość przejęcia władzy przez armię i (w mniejszym stopniu) posłuszeństwo rządzącym (koncepcja I). Te dwie koncepcje są niezależne od siebie i IV jest bardziej powszechna. Ciekawa jest też istotność i podobny poziom ładunków czynnikowych zmiennej oznaczającej posłuszeństwo rządzącym w obu koncepcjach. W tej grupie przekonanie o konieczności posłuszeństwa wobec rządzących jest powszechne.


Dodatkowo można zauważyć, że niezależnie od grupy, wtrącanie się stron trzecich (przejęcie władzy przez wojsko oraz wpływ autorytetów religijnych na prawo) są częścią tej samej koncepcji. Z kolei wsparcie państwa dla bezrobotnych wszędzie występuje zarówno w koncepcjach skupionych na prawach politycznych i równości, jak i postulatach socjalnych.


Przeszkodą w wyciąganiu ogólnych wniosków jest brak danych dla pozostałych państw europejskich; szczególnie niedoreprezentowana jest Europa Zachodnia. Nie można również zakładać, że wszystkie istniejące społeczne koncepcje demokracji zamykają się w tych dziesięciu pytaniach, które znalazły się w ankiecie. Przeprowadzone badanie, mimo ograniczeń, rzuca jednak trochę światła na podobieństwa i różnice w tym, co jest powszechnie uważane za trzon systemu demokratycznego.
